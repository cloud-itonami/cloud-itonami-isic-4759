  "ApplianceRetailGovernor -- the independent compliance layer that earns
  the ApplianceRetailAdvisor the right to commit. The advisor has no
  notion of whether a store is actually registered and license-verified,
  whether a named supply-order vendor is itself a registered/verified
  counterparty, whether its own proposed `:effect` secretly claims a
  direct actuation instead of a mere proposal, or whether it has
  silently drifted into a permanently out-of-scope decision area, so
  this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor's scope is deliberately narrow -- COORDINATION ONLY
  (sales/inventory/warranty-registration transaction logging, delivery-
  and-installation scheduling, household-appliance/furniture/lighting
  merchandise supply-order coordination, warranty/defect-dispute-concern
  flagging). It NEVER performs or authorizes:
    - setting or overriding a shelf/unit price
    - directly finalizing a warranty-claim decision (approving, denying
      or settling a claim, authorizing a warranty refund or replacement,
      closing a claim as resolved)
    - directly finalizing a delivery/installation-safety clearance
      (certifying a gas/electrical hookup as safe, clearing an
      installation hazard as resolved, signing off on an installation
      safety inspection, declaring an installation code-compliant)

  Four HARD checks, ALL permanent, un-overridable by any human approval:

    1. Store unverified           -- the target store record must exist
                                     AND be independently confirmed
                                     `:registered?`/`:verified?` in the
                                     store before ANY proposal for it may
                                     commit or even escalate. Never trusts
                                     a proposal's own claim about the
                                     store -- re-derived from the store's
                                     own record, the same 'ground truth,
                                     not self-report' discipline every
                                     sibling actor's governor uses.
    2. Vendor unverified          -- for `:coordinate-supply-order` ONLY,
                                     the proposal's own drafted `:value`
                                     must name a `:vendor-id` that
                                     resolves to an independently
                                     `:registered?`/`:verified?` vendor
                                     record. A missing vendor-id, or one
                                     that resolves to an unregistered or
                                     unverified vendor, is a HARD block.
    3. Effect not :propose        -- every proposal's `:effect` MUST be
                                     `:propose`. Any other effect value
                                     is, by construction, a claim to
                                     directly actuate/commit outside
                                     governance -- HARD block, not merely
                                     low-confidence.
    4. Scope exclusion            -- ANY proposal (regardless of op)
                                     whose op, summary, rationale, cites
                                     or draft value touches directly
                                     finalizing a warranty-claim decision
                                     OR directly finalizing a delivery/
                                     installation-safety clearance is a
                                     HARD, PERMANENT block -- this actor's
                                     charter excludes that territory
                                     structurally, not as a rollout
                                     milestone. Evaluated UNCONDITIONALLY
                                     on every proposal. An op outside the
                                     closed four-op allowlist is the SAME
                                     failure mode (an advisor proposing
                                     something it was never authorized to
                                     propose) and is folded into this same
                                     check. `:flag-warranty-concern` itself
                                     is never excluded by this check --
                                     surfacing a defect/warranty-dispute
                                     concern for a human is exactly this
                                     actor's job; only FINALIZING/
                                     approving/denying that claim, or
                                     certifying an installation as safe,
                                     is excluded (see
                                     `scope-excluded-terms` below --
                                     phrased as the finalization/
                                     execution ACTION, never a bare noun
                                     like 'warranty' or 'installation', so
                                     the default mock advisor's own
                                     `:flag-warranty-concern` rationale
                                     never self-trips this check).

  Two ESCALATE (SOFT) gates, either forces human sign-off:
    - LLM confidence below the floor.
    - The op is `:flag-warranty-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates to a human,
      regardless of confidence, regardless of how clean the proposal
      otherwise is. `applianceops.phase` independently agrees:
      `:flag-warranty-concern` is never a member of any phase's `:auto`
      set either -- two layers, not one. This actor NEVER directly
      finalizes a warranty-claim decision itself -- flagging a concern
      always routes to a human, never to auto-commit.
    - A `:coordinate-supply-order` whose drafted `:value` names an
      `:estimated-cost` above `supply-cost-threshold` -- a large-value
      merchandise procurement proposal always needs a human sign-off,
      even when the governor and phase would otherwise allow
      auto-commit."
